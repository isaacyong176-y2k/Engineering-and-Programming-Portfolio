Our project was focused on creating a lightweight, reusable lunar tarp stake optimized for secure anchoring in regolith. 
Through extensive brainstorming, prototyping, and research on soil mechanics and material efficiency, 
we developed a drillable stake that minimizes mass, maximizes stability, and support. 
The following was our research and design process.
