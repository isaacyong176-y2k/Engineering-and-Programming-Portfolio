IRR: Declining Role of Nuclear Energy
I conducted a comparative analysis on the long-term viability of nuclear energy versus renewable alternatives such as solar and wind.
Then, I evaluated their environmental impacts, economic feasibility, and public perceptions using academic papers and policy research. 
Finally, I proposed nuclear energy as an optimal solution to reduce environmental risks and long-term costs, and presented my 
findings through a concise, data-supported presentation.

IWA: Impacts of Automotive Cultural Memory on Contemporary Society
I analyzed how automobile cultural memory influences modern society through economic, socio-cultural, and environmental perspectives. 
Next, I connected historical car culture to community values, urban design, American norms, and environmental outcomes. 
To conclude, I created a presentation emphasizing the effects of car-centrism and sustainable mobility transitions.

Throughout this class, I strengthened my research synthesis, data-driven argumentation, and presentation design. 
Additionally, I enhanced my ability to evaluate complex systems, draw evidence-based conclusions, and communicate technical ideas effectively.
