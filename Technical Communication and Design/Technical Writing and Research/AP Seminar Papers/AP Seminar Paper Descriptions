IRR: Declining Role of Nuclear Energy
I worked with a team to analyze the long-term viability of nuclear energy versus renewable alternatives such as solar and wind.
We compared the the environmental impacts, economic feasibility, and public perceptions between nuclear eneryg and renewable alternaties 
using academic papers and policy research. 
Finally, we proposed nuclear energy as an optimal solution to reduce environmental risks and long-term costs, and presented our 
findings through a concise, data-supported presentation. We each wrote our own papers  with a specific focus on a particular lens, 
then we combined our perspectives into an all-encompassing presentation.

IWA: Impacts of Automotive Cultural Memory on Contemporary Society
I analyzed how automobile cultural memory influences modern society through economic, socio-cultural, and environmental perspectives. 
Next, I connected historical car culture to community values, urban design, American norms, and environmental outcomes. 
To conclude, I created a presentation emphasizing the effects of car-centrism and sustainable mobility transitions.

Throughout this class, I strengthened my research synthesis, data-driven argumentation, collaboration skills, and presentation design. 
Additionally, I enhanced my ability to evaluate complex systems, draw evidence-based conclusions, and communicate technical ideas effectively.
